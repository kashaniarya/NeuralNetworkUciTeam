Welcome to Arya's Branch

Arya v4 and v5
  Shows various models with differing hyperparamters
  Clearly shows improvements here and there.
  Able to get training data over 95% accurate but validation data overfits
  and unfortunately auc score does not improve.


Arya_PatchCam_ScatterPlots
  There are notes/comments in file
  Shows various scatter plots


Arya_v1.ipynb ~ a link that henry sent in the discord. 
  ~ I plugged it in and ran it on google colab
  ~ model is about 80% confident / accurate
 
  + my main objective is to understand what is the thought processes behind deciding what layers were chosen
  + how i can research to effectively test to try to improve model
  
  -note: takes about 20 minutes for model to train (using colab built-in gpu feature)
